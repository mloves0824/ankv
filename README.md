## What is ankv?

Ankv is a distributed key-value storage system developed and maintained by Antalk Team, with targets of high availability, high performance, strong consistency and ease of use. The original motivation of this project is to replace Apache HBase for users who only need simple key-value schema but require low latency and high availability. It is based on the open source brpc framework, and uses modified RocksDB as underlying storage engine. The consensus algorithm it uses is raft.
